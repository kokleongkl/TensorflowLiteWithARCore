# Tensorflow lite with ARCore
This is a research project of harnessing the power of ML and ARCore. This allow for detection of object
and render a ViewRenderable to display information on the dectected object.

do note the model that I have trained and converted to TFLite is a custom CNN model.

Will be creating another repo for the machine learning component

Do open up issues when you found some thing went wrong!

 This could not be achieve without the help of the repos below:
