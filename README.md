# Tensorflow lite with ARCore
This is a research project of harnessing the power of ML and ARCore. This allow for detection of object
and HUD will be displayed after it dectected an object.


# Machine Learning Component
do note the model that I have trained and converted to TFLite is a custom CNN model.

Will be creating another repo for the machine learning component

Do open up issues when you found some thing went wrong!
